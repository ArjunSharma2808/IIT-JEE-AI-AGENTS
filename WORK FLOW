Project Workflow
1. Environment Setup
Install Dependencies: Ensure all required libraries and tools are installed in your Python environment.
Setup API Keys: If using external APIs like GPT-4, configure your API keys for access.
2. Data Collection and Preparation
Gather Dataset: Collect or source a dataset of existing IIT-JEE questions, categorized by subject (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics).
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure it is suitable for model training. This may involve tokenization, text normalization, and formatting the data into a suitable structure.
3. Model Fine-Tuning
Load Pre-Trained Model: Utilize a pre-trained language model (e.g., GPT-4) from the transformers library.
Fine-Tune the Model: Fine-tune the model on the preprocessed dataset to adapt it to the specific task of generating JEE-style questions. This step may include adjusting hyperparameters, choosing appropriate loss functions, and evaluating performance.
4. Question Generation
Generate Questions: Use the fine-tuned model to generate new questions across various subjects. Specify parameters like subject, difficulty level, and question format.
Post-Processing: Review and filter the generated questions to ensure they meet the quality and complexity expected of IIT-JEE Advanced questions. Adjust and refine as necessary.
5. Evaluation and Validation
Human Review: Subject the generated questions to review by subject matter experts to ensure accuracy and appropriateness.
Model Validation: Compare generated questions against a validation set to assess the modelâ€™s performance and make iterative improvements.
6. Deployment
Integrate with Educational Tools: Deploy the AI-generated questions into practice platforms, mock exams, or other educational tools.
Automate Question Generation: Optionally, automate the process to periodically generate and update question banks.
7. Continuous Improvement
Model Updates: Continuously update the model with new data and fine-tuning to adapt to changes in exam patterns or question styles.
User Feedback Loop: Incorporate feedback from educators and students to refine the model further.
