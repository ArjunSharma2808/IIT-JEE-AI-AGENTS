**Project Requirements**

To run the JEE AI Agent project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed and configured:

 **1. Python Environment**
- Python 3.7 or higher

 **2. Libraries and Dependencies**
- **transformers**: For working with pre-trained language models.
- **torch**: Required for running GPT models.
- **pandas**: For handling datasets and data manipulation.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **IPython**: For running and displaying notebook-related commands.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running the provided `.ipynb` file.

These can be installed using pip:
```bash
pip install transformers torch pandas numpy ipython jupyter
```

 **3. Hardware Requirements**
- **GPU (optional but recommended)**: For faster processing, especially when generating large sets of questions.
- Sufficient memory to handle model operations (minimum 8GB of RAM is recommended).

 **4. Dataset**
- A dataset of existing IIT-JEE questions (or similar) for fine-tuning and validation. This can be custom-built or sourced from educational repositories.

**5. API Keys**
- If using GPT-4 or any other AI models via API (e.g., OpenAI), ensure you have valid API keys set up.
