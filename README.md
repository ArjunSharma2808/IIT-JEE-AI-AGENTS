AI Agents to create questions for JEE Advanced using GPT-4o


The IIT-JEE Advanced exam is one of the most challenging entrance tests for engineering aspirants in India. Creating high-quality questions that match the rigor and depth of this exam is a critical task, typically done by expert educators. However, with advancements in AI, it's now possible to automate and enhance this process using language models like GPT-4.

In this project, GPT-4 is fine-tuned on a comprehensive dataset that includes existing IIT-JEE Advanced questions, educational content, and problem-solving techniques across physics, chemistry, and mathematics. By training the AI on such data, the model learns the specific patterns, formats, and complexity required for JEE questions.

The AI agents created in this project are capable of generating new questions that not only align with the curriculum but also challenge students in the same way the actual exam does. These questions can vary in difficulty and cover a broad spectrum of concepts, making them valuable for both practice and assessment. Additionally, the AI-generated questions can be reviewed and adjusted by educators, providing a scalable way to develop a large pool of high-quality questions. This approach not only saves time but also introduces a novel method for enhancing the preparation resources available to students aiming for IIT.
